Here is my challenge submission for Shopify's Summer 2022 Front End developer internship! To build this, I used React, the NASA APOD API to retrive images and associating data as well as the [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) library.

## Introduction

This web application was made for the Summer 2022 Shopify Frontend Developer Intern Challenge. It utilizes NASA's APOD API to display randomized images fetched from the API as well as information such as the title, date and image explanation. Additionally, there is a loading animation that is displayed while the user is waiting for images to get fetched and the user is given the ability to like and unlike images using an animating heart button.

## Technologies Used
- React
- [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
